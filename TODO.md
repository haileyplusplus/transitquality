- Robustness
  - More error and summary reporting
  - Better appending to existing state
  - Maybe store in database
  - Notion of trips being complete or incomplete
  - Validation of assumptions: trip id uniqueness, vid uniqueness, etc
  - Normalize all fields on loading from csv (type mismatches)
  - stop_info join needs to be on day in addition to trip no (filter other df)
